# Restaurant-Reservation-Web-App

A comprehensive system for managing restaurant table reservations, designed to streamline the booking process for both customers and restaurant staff. This project leverages **.NET** for a robust backend API and **React.js** for a dynamic, interactive frontend, with data managed in **SQL Server** using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.

## Description

This project aims to build a robust and user-friendly online platform for restaurant reservations. It provides customers with an easy way to book tables, view availability, and manage their reservations. For restaurant owners and staff, it offers tools to efficiently manage bookings, allocate tables, and track customer information. The backend is powered by **.NET**, offering a secure and scalable API, while the frontend, built with **React.js**, delivers a responsive and intuitive user experience. All database operations are handled through **SQL Server**, and you'll interact with the database using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (with .NET Desktop development and ASP.NET and web development workloads)
    * [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
    * [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (Express edition is sufficient for development)
    * [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16)

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jatin-Kesnani/Restaurant-Reservation-Web-App.git
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd restaurant-reservations
    ```
4.  **Database Setup (SQL Server / SSMS):**
    * **Create Database:** Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** and connect to your SQL Server instance. Create a new database, for example, `RestaurantReservationsDb`.
    * **Configure Connection String:** In your backend project (e.g., `backend/RestaurantReservations.Api`), open `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Development.json`. Update the `DefaultConnection` string to point to your newly created SQL Server database.
        ```json
        {
          "ConnectionStrings": {
            "DefaultConnection": "Server=YourSqlServerName;Database=RestaurantReservationsDb;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
          },
          "JwtSettings": {
            "Secret": "YourVeryStrongAndLongSecretKeyHere"
          }
        }
        ```
        *Replace `YourSqlServerName` with your actual SQL Server instance name.*
    * **Apply Migrations:** Navigate into the backend project directory (e.g., `cd backend/RestaurantReservations.Api`) in your terminal. Apply the Entity Framework Core database migrations to create the necessary tables:
        ```bash
        dotnet ef database update
        ```

5.  **Backend Setup (.NET):**
    * From the backend project directory (e.g., `cd backend/RestaurantReservations.Api`), restore NuGet packages:
        ```bash
        dotnet restore
        ```
    * Ensure any other necessary configurations (like JWT secret, email credentials) are set in your `appsettings.json` or environment variables.

6.  **Frontend Setup (React.js):**
    * Navigate into the frontend project directory (e.g., `cd frontend/restaurant-reservations-ui`).
    * Install npm dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install # or yarn install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the frontend root and add your backend API URL:
        ```
        # .env example for frontend
        REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://localhost:7001 # Or your deployed backend URL
        ```

## Usage

### Starting the Development Servers

1.  **Start the backend server (.NET):**
    * Navigate to your backend project directory (e.g., `cd backend/RestaurantReservations.Api`).
    * Run the application:
        ```bash
        dotnet run
        ```
    * The backend API will typically run on `https://localhost:7001` (or a port assigned by .NET CLI). You can access **Swagger UI** at `https://localhost:7001/swagger` for API documentation and testing.

2.  **Start the frontend development server (React.js):**
    * Navigate to your frontend project directory (e.g., `cd frontend/restaurant-reservations-ui`).
    * Start the React app:
        ```bash
        npm start # or yarn start
        ```
    * The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Accessing the Application

Once both servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
